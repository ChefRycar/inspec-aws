# aws_config_delivery_channel

Use the `aws_config_delivery_channel` InSpec audit resource to test properties of the AWS Config service settings in the current region.  A Delivery Channel determines what is done with notifications when an AWS resource is altered.  The notifications are generated by a Configuration Recorder.  This resource is usually used in conjunction with `aws_config_configuration_recorder`.

AWS currently allows at most one delivery channel per region.  By default, its name is 'default'.

## Examples

    # Verify the default delivery channel exists
    describe aws_config_delivery_channel do
      it { should exist }
    end

    # Verify your custom-named delivery channel has the right bucket
    describe aws_config_delivery_channel('my-channel') do
      its('s3_bucket') { should cmp 'my-bucket' }
    end
